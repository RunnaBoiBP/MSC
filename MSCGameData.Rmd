Now, we will combine the season data frames into one data frame containing all
of the games from each season collected.

## Combining the Season Data Frames

First, we will join the 2014, 2015, 2016 data frames into a frame containing all three seasons.

```{r}
MSCData <- rbind(S2014, S2015, S2016)

MSCData <-
+  MSCData %>% 
+  mutate(id = paste(id, Season, sep = "_"))
```
