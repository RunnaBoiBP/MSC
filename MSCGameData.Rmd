```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Now, we will combine the season data frames into one data frame containing all
of the games from each season collected.

##Labeling the Data

First, I will re-label the ID numbers so that they come in order but are separated by season.

```{r}
S2015$id <- 145:288
S2016$id <- 289:400
```

## Combining the Season Data Frames

Now that there is no conflict with id labeling, we will join the 2014 and 2015 data
tables, then add the 2016 data table to that.

```{r}
MSCData <- S2014
for (i in 1:nrow(S2015)){
  MSCData <- S2015[i,]
}
for (i in nrow(S2016)){
  MSCData <- S2016[i,]
}
```
